Yelp To Calendar

This is a simple bookmarklet that adds a "Add to Calendar" button to pages on Yelp.

Use it to remind yourself to visit a business.

Simple Installation Steps:

1. Drag [YelpToCalendar](javascript:void($.getScript('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiofish/yelp_to_calendar/master/add_to_calendar.js'));) to your bookmarks bar.
2. Go to any Yelp business page.
3. Click the bookmarklet.
4. See the newly added "Add to Calendar" on the Yelp page.
5. Now you can interact with the button.


Agree that this isnt ideal since it takes two steps to add to calendar but its better than the alternative of creating a calendar from scratch.
