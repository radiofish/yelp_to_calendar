Yelp To Calendar

This is a simple bookmarklet that adds a "Add to Calendar" button to pages on Yelp.

Use it to remind yourself to visit a business.

Follow the simple [Installation Steps](http://radiofish.github.io/yelp_to_calendar)

Agree that this isnt ideal since it takes two steps to add to calendar but its better than the alternative of creating a calendar from scratch.
